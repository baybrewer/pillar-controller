# Vision-Based Auto-Mapping Design

## Goal

Automatically discover LED strip wiring (channel, offset, direction, LED count) and physical positions by streaming live video from an iPhone camera while the Pi sequences through LEDs. Replaces manual strip-by-strip configuration in the Setup screen.

## Architecture

The iPhone streams live video to the Pi via SRT. The Pi controls LEDs and analyzes incoming video frames simultaneously — it knows exactly which electrical address is lit at every moment. A hierarchical 4-phase scan discovers strips quickly (~1-2 minutes per camera angle). Since the pillar is a cylinder, the user rotates and re-scans to cover all strips; the system merges results across angles.

## Stream Ingestion

- **Protocol:** SRT (Secure Reliable Transport) — peer-to-peer, no server needed
- **iPhone app:** Larix Broadcaster in SRT caller mode
- **Pi listener:** PyAV (`av` package, already in pyproject.toml as `video` extra) opens `srt://0.0.0.0:9000?mode=listener` via its ffmpeg backend
- **Frame format:** Decoded to numpy arrays (H×W×3 uint8 RGB) at source framerate (~30fps)
- **No new Python dependencies** — PyAV already available; blob detection uses Pillow + NumPy (same approach as existing `geometry.py`)
- **System dependency:** `ffmpeg` with SRT support (apt: `ffmpeg`, should already be present for the `video` extra)

### Connection Flow

1. User taps "Auto Map" in Setup UI
2. Pi starts SRT listener on port 9000
3. UI displays: "Point Larix at `srt://<pi-ip>:9000`" with connection status indicator
4. Once connected, Pi captures 5-10 baseline frames (all LEDs off) for background subtraction
5. Scan begins automatically once baseline is stable

## Scan Protocol

### Phase 1: Channel Probe (~10 seconds)

For each of the 5 active OctoWS2811 channels:

1. Light ALL LEDs on the channel full white
2. Capture frame, subtract baseline
3. If bright region detected → channel has visible strips from this camera angle
4. Light first half (LEDs 0-171) → detect region
5. Light second half (LEDs 172-343) → detect region
6. Result: list of visible `(channel, half)` pairs with approximate bounding boxes

### Phase 2: Coarse-to-Fine Segmentation (~20 seconds)

For each visible channel-half:

1. **Coarse sweep** — light every 10th LED across the range (0, 10, 20, ... 170), recording which produce visible blobs and their centroid positions
2. **Cluster visible runs** — group contiguous visible LEDs by centroid continuity. A position jump (>N pixels between adjacent samples) marks a **visibility gap**. All gaps are treated equally at this stage — the system does NOT attempt to distinguish occlusion (strip wraps behind cylinder) from electrical boundaries (daisy-chain) from a single camera angle.
3. **Refine endpoints** — for each visible run, binary search within the 10-LED gaps at the start and end to find exact first/last visible LED
4. **LED count** — total visible LEDs per run. Runs are recorded as `(channel, start_index, end_index, centroids)`. Daisy-chain boundaries (where strip 1 ends and strip 2 begins on the same channel) are only committed when corroborated: either (a) a second scan angle shows the gap persists even when both sides are visible, or (b) the electrical index crosses the known 172-LED boundary AND positions are spatially discontinuous. Until corroborated, gaps remain "unresolved" and the system presents them to the user for confirmation.
5. **Partial visibility** — if a strip wraps behind the cylinder, only the visible segment is mapped in this pass. Re-scan from another angle fills in the rest.

### Phase 3: Position Sampling (~30-60 seconds)

For each discovered strip:

1. Scan every 5th LED, recording `(led_index, centroid_x, centroid_y)`
2. Average centroid across 2-3 frames to reduce jitter
3. **Direction inference** — fit a principal axis through the sampled centroids (PCA or linear regression). Direction is determined by whether LED index increases along the principal axis in one direction or the other. This handles tilted phones and diagonal framing — not dependent on raw screen-space y.
4. Interpolate between samples for full LED coverage (strips are physically linear)

### Phase 4: Results & Merge

1. Build candidate `StripMapping` entries from discovered data
2. Build `SpatialMap` positions from samples + interpolation
3. If strips were already mapped from a previous camera angle, merge: more-complete data (more LEDs visible, higher confidence) wins
4. Present results to user in UI for review before applying

## Vision / Blob Detection

All detection uses frame differencing to handle ambient light.

### Detection Pipeline (per LED probe)

1. **Baseline frame** — captured at scan start (all LEDs off), refreshed periodically to handle ambient lighting drift
2. **Lit frame** — captured with target LED(s) on. Wait 2-3 frames for LED to stabilize (camera exposure latency)
3. **Difference image** — `abs(lit_frame - baseline)` isolates LED contribution from ambient
4. **Threshold + mask** — threshold the difference image (NumPy boolean mask where brightness > threshold), find the largest connected bright region
5. **Centroid** — brightness-weighted centroid of the masked region (NumPy coordinate averaging) gives sub-pixel position
6. **Confidence score** — based on blob brightness, size, roundness. No blob or multiple blobs = low confidence, flagged for review

### Robustness

- **Minimum brightness threshold** — rejects camera noise and ambient flicker
- **Maximum blob size** — rejects reflections or large bright areas
- **Temporal averaging** — for Phase 3 position sampling, average centroid across 2-3 frames
- **LED color** — scan uses full white for maximum contrast. Color order doesn't affect detection (tinted blob still detected). Color order detection deferred to existing `rgb_order.py` as optional follow-up

### Libraries used

- **PyAV** (`av`) — SRT stream ingestion, frame decode to numpy arrays (already a project dependency)
- **NumPy** — frame differencing (`np.abs`), thresholding, centroid calculation, interpolation
- **Pillow** — optional: JPEG encoding for WebSocket camera view, overlay drawing
- No OpenCV required — all vision operations use NumPy array math, consistent with existing `geometry.py`

## API Endpoints

All under `/api/setup/auto-map/`. All endpoints require Bearer auth (camera feed is sensitive).

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| `/start` | POST | Yes | Begin scan. Body: `{"channels": [0,1,2,3,4]}` — which OctoWS2811 outputs to scan (default: all active). Returns `{"session_id": "...", "srt_url": "srt://<ip>:9000"}`. Only one scan session may run at a time; starting a new one aborts any active session. |
| `/stop` | POST | Yes | Abort current scan session. Restores previous scene. |
| `/status` | GET | Yes | Returns `{"session_id": "...", "phase": 1-4, "progress": 0.0-1.0, "strips_found": N, "stream_connected": bool}`. Clients should check `session_id` matches their expected session to avoid acting on stale data after a session restart. |
| `/results` | GET | Yes | Returns `{"session_id": "...", "candidates": [...]}`. Each candidate: `{candidate_id, channel, offset, led_count, direction, confidence, status, visible_count}` where status is `"confirmed"`, `"unresolved"`, or `"rejected"`. `confidence` is a candidate-level score (0.0-1.0) based on average blob brightness and detection consistency across the strip. |
| `/resolve` | POST | Yes | Resolve ambiguous candidates. Body: `{"session_id": "...", "resolutions": [{"candidate_id": 0, "action": "accept"}, {"candidate_id": 1, "action": "reject"}, {"candidate_id": 2, "action": "merge", "merge_with": 3}]}`. Actions: `accept` (confirm as a strip), `reject` (discard), `merge` (combine two candidates that are the same strip seen from different angles). Returns updated results. |
| `/apply` | POST | Yes | Commit confirmed results. Body: `{"session_id": "..."}`. Fails if any candidates are still `"unresolved"` — all must be resolved first. Transaction sequence: (1) validate confirmed strips, (2) compile output plan in memory, (3) stage both files to temp paths via atomic writers, (4) only if both temp writes succeed, swap installation.yaml then spatial_map.json, (5) hot-apply compiled plan. If any step fails before the swap, no files are modified. If the second swap fails after the first succeeded, log an error and return the partial state (the user can re-apply or reset). Returns the new strip list. |
| `/ws` | WebSocket | Yes | Live camera frame (downscaled) + blob overlay + JSON progress. Auth via `?token=` query param (WebSocket can't send headers). |

### WebSocket Message Types

- **Binary frame:** JPEG-encoded camera image (downscaled to ~640px wide) with blob overlay circles drawn in. Prefixed with 1-byte type marker `0x01`. Sent at ~10fps to keep bandwidth manageable.
- **JSON status:** Text message with `{"phase": 2, "progress": 0.45, "message": "Channel 2, LED 85", "strips_found": [...]}`. Sent on each scan step.

### LED Control During Scan

The scan uses a dedicated `ScanEffect` (a standard effect class with `render()`) that the auto-mapper injects via `renderer.activate_scene('_scan', params)`. The ScanEffect's params are updated in-place by the mapper each step: `{"mode": "channel_flood", "channel": 2}` or `{"mode": "single_led", "channel": 0, "index": 47}`. The renderer's existing brightness/gamma/output-plan pipeline applies normally.

**Scene ownership:** On scan start, the mapper snapshots:
- `renderer.state.current_scene` (scene name string, e.g. `"rainbow"` or `"media:clip1"`)
- The saved params for that scene from `state_manager.get_effect_params(scene_name)`
- `renderer.state.blackout` (bool)

The scan forces `renderer.state.blackout = False` so probe LEDs are actually visible. On scan end (complete or abort), it restores all three: `renderer.activate_scene(saved_name, saved_params, media_manager=deps.media_manager)` then `renderer.state.blackout = saved_blackout`. This handles both generative and media scenes (the `media_manager` kwarg is required for `media:` prefixed scenes per `renderer.py:178-198`). If no scene was active (`current_scene` is None), it explicitly clears the scan effect: `renderer.current_effect = None`, `renderer.state.current_scene = None`, then restores `renderer.state.blackout = saved_blackout`. This ensures the `_scan` effect is fully removed and the renderer returns to idle (black output unless blackout was off and another scene is later activated).

**Concurrency guard:** Only one scan session at a time. The `/start` endpoint checks for an active session and aborts it before starting a new one. The scan task runs as a background `asyncio.Task` — cancellation via `/stop` triggers cleanup.

### Reconnect & Abort

- **Stream disconnect during scan:** If the SRT stream drops, the scan pauses and waits up to 30 seconds for reconnection. If the stream doesn't return, the scan aborts and partial results are preserved (user can apply what was found or re-scan).
- **Abort:** `/stop` cancels the scan task, restores the previous scene, and returns partial results.

## UI (Setup Screen Additions)

- **"Auto Map" button** — opens the auto-map panel within the existing Setup screen
- **Stream connection indicator** — shows SRT URL for Larix, green when connected
- **Live camera view** — canvas showing incoming stream with detected blobs highlighted as colored circles
- **Phase progress** — current phase (1-4), progress bar, descriptive text ("Scanning channel 2, LED 85...")
- **Strip discovery table** — fills in as strips are found: strip ID, channel, offset, LED count, direction, confidence
- **Coverage indicator** — which strips are mapped vs unmapped. Encourages user to rotate for remaining strips
- **"Apply" button** — appears after scan completes. Shows preview of discovered mapping before committing
- **"Re-scan" button** — run again from a different angle to fill in missing strips

## Output Format

### 1. StripMapping (→ installation.yaml)

Each discovered strip produces a `StripMapping` entry:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `id` | Auto-assigned (0, 1, 2...) |
| `channel` | Discovered in Phase 1 (which OctoWS2811 output) |
| `offset` | Discovered in Phase 2 (LED offset on channel) |
| `direction` | Inferred in Phase 3 (principal-axis projection of centroid trend) |
| `led_count` | Discovered in Phase 2 (boundary search) |
| `color_order` | Default "BGR" (optionally detected via rgb_order.py follow-up) |
| `brightness` | Default 1.0 (user adjusts manually) |

Feeds directly into existing pipeline: `StripInstallation` → `compile_strip_plan()` → `apply_output_plan()`.

### 2. SpatialMap (→ spatial_map.json)

Must conform to the existing `SpatialMap` / `StripGeometry` schema in `pi/app/config/spatial_map.py`:

```python
SpatialMap:
  schema_version: 2  # bumped from 1 — v2 allows null entries in positions
  profile_id: "auto_map"
  coordinate_space: "front_projection_uv"
  camera_resolution: [W, H]  # from stream
  visible_strips: [0, 1, 3, 5, ...]  # union of all strips mapped across all accepted scans
  bounds: {x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max}
  strips: [StripGeometry, ...]

StripGeometry:
  id: int  # matches StripMapping.id
  anchors: [[x,y]|null, ...]  # 5 canonical strip points (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of full strip), null if unobserved
  positions: [[x,y]|null, ...]  # ALWAYS full strip length (led_count entries), indexed by absolute LED index; null if unobserved
  fit_method: "auto_map_v1"
  visibility: "direct" | "partial"  # partial if some LEDs wrap behind cylinder
```

**Populating from scan data:**
- `positions` — ALWAYS a full-length array of `led_count` entries, indexed by absolute LED index (0 through led_count-1). Observed positions are stored as `[x_uv, y_uv]` in image-space UV: `x_uv = x_px / frame_width`, `y_uv = 1.0 - (y_px / frame_height)` (bottom-left origin). Unobserved LEDs (not visible from any scan angle yet) are stored as `null`. This uses the camera resolution as the stable coordinate frame, NOT a per-scan bounding box — ensuring coordinates remain comparable across scan angles. The `bounds` field is computed as metadata (min/max of all non-null strip positions) but is not used for normalization.
- `anchors` — always 5 entries at canonical strip positions: LED indices at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of `led_count`. If the LED at that index was observed, store its `[x_uv, y_uv]`; if unobserved, store `null`. This means partially-visible strips have sparse anchors (e.g., `[null, null, [0.3, 0.5], [0.35, 0.7], [0.4, 0.9]]` when only the bottom half was visible). Anchors are updated on re-scan as positions fill in.
- `visibility` — "direct" if all LEDs on the strip have non-null positions, "partial" if any are still null
- `visible_strips` — the union of all strip IDs that have at least one non-null position, accumulated across all accepted scans
- Multi-angle merge: when re-scanning, newly observed positions fill in null entries. For positions already observed in a previous scan, the merge policy is candidate-level: if the new scan's candidate has higher `confidence` (better average blob quality) AND more `visible_count` (more LEDs seen), all of its positions replace the existing entry. Otherwise, existing positions are kept and only null slots are filled.

Feeds into existing `SpatialMap` for front-projection effects.

### Merge Behavior on Re-scan

**Reconciliation key:** A newly discovered run is matched to an existing strip by `(channel, overlapping electrical index range)`. If a new run on channel 2, indices 0-170 overlaps with an existing strip on channel 2, offset 0, led_count 172, they're the same strip. If geometric consistency also holds (centroid positions for overlapping indices are within a tolerance), the match is confirmed and the existing entry is updated with the more complete data.

**Ambiguous matches** (e.g., overlapping index range but inconsistent geometry) are flagged in the UI as "needs confirmation" — the user decides whether to accept or discard.

- Matched strips → updated with more-complete data (more visible LEDs, higher confidence), not duplicated
- Strips not visible in the current scan → left untouched
- "Reset Mapping" option available to clear and start fresh

| `pi/pyproject.toml` | No new dependencies needed (PyAV already in `video` extra) |
| `pi/app/setup/patterns.py` | Extend with single-LED and channel-flood patterns for scan phases |

## Dependencies

- **No new Python dependencies** — PyAV (`av>=12.0`) already in pyproject.toml `video` extra; Pillow and NumPy already core dependencies
- `ffmpeg` with SRT support (system, apt) — required as PyAV's backend for SRT protocol. Should already be present if `video` extra is installed.

## Non-Goals

- Color order auto-detection during scan (existing `rgb_order.py` handles this separately)
- 3D position mapping (2D camera coordinates only, per-angle)
- Automatic camera position detection or multi-camera fusion
- Sub-LED precision (interpolation between every-5th sample is sufficient for linear strips)
