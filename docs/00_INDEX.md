# LED Pillar Planning Packet

This packet is designed to be handed directly to Claude Code / Opus as the implementation specification for a Raspberry Pi + Teensy 4.1 + OctoWS2811 LED pillar controller.

## One-line conclusion

Yes: **Raspberry Pi → USB → Teensy 4.1 → OctoWS2811 → WS2812 strips** is a sound architecture for this project, and with the current physical plan of **10 strips × 172 LEDs**, paired into **5 serpentine channels of 344 LEDs each**, the hard WS2812 wire-time ceiling is about **96.4 FPS** using PJRC's `30 µs per LED + 50 µs reset` timing, or about **94.3 FPS** using a more conservative `280 µs` reset assumption.[1][4]

That means:

- **30 FPS** is trivial.
- **60 FPS** is the correct default product target.
- **90-ish FPS** is physically possible if the Pi pipeline and USB framing stay lean.
- The Teensy is not the bottleneck here; **the longest WS2812 channel is**.

## Recommended implementation stance

- Use **one Teensy 4.1 + OctoWS2811 adaptor**
- Wire **5 active outputs**, one per pair of adjacent strips
- Let the **Pi own all UX, media, audio-reactive logic, scene selection, uploads, playlists, and control**
- Let the **Teensy own only packet ingestion, mapping to Octo buffers, and DMA-driven LED output**
- Keep the render model **logical 10 × 172 cylindrical canvas**, regardless of the serpentine wiring

## Important caveat

PJRC's stock `VideoDisplay` example proves that Raspberry Pi-like computers can stream video to Teensy boards, but that example has its own layout assumptions, including `LED_HEIGHT` being a multiple of 8. Your pillar's logical height is **172**, so the example is a **reference implementation only**, not a drop-in solution.[1]
